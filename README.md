# nba-analysis

Creating an NBA statistics application that will have individual statistics, both personal and performance, for each player in the league as well as their splits under a variety of conditions (Home v Away, against certain teams, etc.)

Using Selenium to scrape websites for player and team statistics, the goal is to have a hub that stores all of this information and allows people to compare statistics between two active players or teams.

Any and all information that is pulled will be stored in GCP for further evaluation.
